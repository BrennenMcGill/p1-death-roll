## **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
> The purpose of this project is to collaboratively develop an application that meets a real-world need. The project should include a quality user story
and acceptance criteria to aid development.The group should utilize the font-end development skills learned in the first six modules of the course.
The group is expected to present the project and convince an audience that it serves a purpose. Full project and presentation requirements are detailed below.  

> The COVID-19 Pandemic, the Black Lives Matter Movement, and natural phenomenons such as earthquakes and fires, have quickly moved to the forefront of concern across the world. As a result, Americans are experiencing higher instances of depression and anxiety ([More Information](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-video-games-relieve-stress-4110349)). During periods of high stress, fear, anxiety, and depression, gaming has become a widely used approach for stress recovery ([More Information](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-video-games-relieve-stress-4110349)). These heighted mental health concerns, coupled with millions of Americans forced to stay home, have led to a surge in the gaming industry ([More Information](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/05/12/video-game-industry-coronavirus/)). Gaming platforms have grown in demand, and this project aims to meet a small piece of that need. 

> Death Roll is a gambling game highly utilized in gaming platforms, such as World of Warcraft. This betting game is used to not only bet game loot, money, or other valuable goods, but also to bet real-world materials. This application provides a user interface to aid in Death Roll game play. We hope that this fun game can help allieviate the increased anxiety and depression rates during these unprecedented times. The usage and functionality of the application are outlined below.

## **USAGE**
> This application utilizes two APIs, Slack and Giphy. To experience the full utilization of these APIs, a user must do the following:  
> 1. Join the [Death-Roll Slack group](death-roll.slack.com). The channel called #match-results, displays a random *winner* or *loser* Giphy image after each Death Roll game is played.  
> 2. Additionally, users must supply a Slack API authentication key, which is used to identify a user. For full details on setting up Slack authentication, please see [Slack's API documentation](https://api.slack.com/web#:~:text=Authenticate%20your%20Web%20API%20requests,behalf%20of%20users%20and%20workspaces.). The user's Slack hook should look similar to this:  
> {"SLACK_WEB_HOOK": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/[USER HOOK KEY HERE]"}


## **FUNCTIONALITY**
1. When the application loads, the player is presented with a themed user interface, a 'Start Playing' button, and a 'Leaderboard' button.  
![Home Screen](/assets/images/homescreen.png)
2. If the 'Leaderboard' button is clicked, a modal appears that shows the top 5 winning players. The user can close the modal to return to the home screen.  
![Leaderboard](/assets/images/leaderboard.png)
3. When the player clicks the 'Start Playing' button, a modal appears for the user to input a username, read game instructions, and begin the game.  
![Username Modal](/assets/images/user-modal.png)
4. If a user clicks the 'Instructions' button, a nested modal appears with game instructions. When a player is done reading the instructions, they can click the 'Back' button to return to the previous modal.  
![Instructions Modal](/assets/images/instructions.png)
5. After a username is typed, the player can click the 'Begin Game' button to start playing. When the game begins, the user is presented with a game card of their username and starting gold on the left, and the NPC's name and starting gold on the right. In the middle of the interface, the player is presented with a text field to input their bet and a button to roll the dice when they are ready to play.  
![Game Interface](/assets/images/game-cards.png)
6. A random number generator is used to determine the roll of the player and the NPC. This rolled number will appear in the game cards. The opponent with the higher rolled number wins the round and will see the a green outline surrounding their game card and a confirmation that they won. The losing opponent will have a red outline for their game card and confirmation that they lost. The amount of gold each opponent has is then updated.  
![Game Results](/assets/images/results-cards.png)
7. The player then places another bet and rolls the dice again. This game play continues until one of the opponents runs out of gold. The player with remaining gold wins the game and an appropriate Giphy is sent to the Death-Roll Slack channel.   
![Slack Channel](/assets/images/slack-results.png)
8. When a game ends, a modal appears detailing the player's final points, number of wins, and winning streak for the game. The user's scores are saved to the local storage if they make the top 5. At the bottom of the modal, the player has the option of playing again.
